# About

This project is my playground to try stuff I normally wouldn't because, let's be real, **awesome resources** can be rarer than a *lightmode vim user* (seriously, do those exist?).

## What Ifs and Ideas

There are so many things I've always wanted to try, those *"what ifs"* that keep popping up in my head, like what if I can turn **vim** into a full operating system or maybe write a script that automatically generates documentation from my cryptic *Vim* keybindings? This might be a long shot, but wouldn't it be **amazing**?

# Motivation

There has always been a burning desire to understand the **inner workings** of things to the point where I can build anything I can imagine. After all, isn't that the spirit of programming – being able to make my own tiny world with my own ideas?

Over the past few years, I have been taking a break from online platforms while focusing on gathering resources that intrigue me. I gathered resources from *Reddit* posts, **GitHub hidden gems**, and personal blogs of inspiring people.

These projects all shared a core principle: they were built from the ground up as a testament to the pursuit of **true digital freedom**, much like the fabled examples. Bored by the endless stream of YouTube tutorials promising mastery in *"X days,"* I craved a different path – not just replicating someone else's efforts but actively participating in the creation process, gleaning knowledge with every step.

Sharing this project as an **open-source** *"look what I made, you can too"* is my way of showing you how I did it, learning from my mistakes, and maybe even meeting some people who are just as excited about building stuff as I am.
