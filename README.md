## About

This project is my playground to try stuff I normally wouldn't because, let's be real, awesome resources can be rarer than a lightmode vim user (seriously, do those exist?).

There are so many things I've always wanted to try, those "what ifs" that keep popping up in my head, like what if I can turn vim into a full operating system or maybe write a script that automatically generates documentation from my cryptic Vim keybindings?  This might be a long shot, but wouldn't it be amazing?

## Motivation
There has always been a burning desire to understand the inner workings of things to the point where I can build anything I can imagine. After all, isn't that the spirit of programming – being able to make my own tiny world with my own ideas?

Over the past few years, I have been taking a break from online platforms while focusing on gathering resources that intrigue me. I gathered resources from Reddit posts, GitHub hidden gems and personal blogs of inspiring people.

These projects all shared a core principle: they were built from the ground up as a testament to the pursuit of true digital freedom, much like the fabled examples. Bored by the endless stream of YouTube tutorials promising mastery in "X days," I craved a different path – not just replicating someone else's efforts but actively participating in the creation process, gleaning knowledge with every step.

Sharing this project as an open-source "look what I made, you can too" is my way of showing you how I did it, learning from my mistakes, and maybe even meeting some people who are just as excited about building stuff as I am.
