# Out of Curios

This project is my playground to try stuff I normally wouldn't because, let's be real, awesome resources can be rarer than a lightmode vim user (seriously, do those exist?).

There are so many things I've always wanted to try, those "what ifs" that keep popping up in my head, like what if I can turn vim into a full operating system or maybe write a script that automatically generates documentation from my cryptic Vim keybindings?  This might be a long shot, but wouldn't it be amazing?

## Contributing

* I encourage you to fork the repository, tinker with the code, and submit a pull request with your awesome changes. Even small improvements or bug fixes are a huge help!

* Got a wild idea that aligns with the project's spirit? Open an issue and let's brainstorm! The crazier the idea, the better (well, maybe not too crazy).
